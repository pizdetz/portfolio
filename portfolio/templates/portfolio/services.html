    <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Colton Sweeney. I'm a 19 year old web developer living in Apex, NC. I've been programming for about 6 years
        and designing websites for a little less than that. I enjoy scripting languages such as Python and JavaScript, but
        I also enjoy Object Oriented languages for their complexity and breadth of features. I enjoy hiking the Appalachian
        Mountains as well as visiting the town of Wilmington. I can relate to cats and dogs better than I do with most people.
        I enjoy all types of music - Heavy Metal and EDM for when I work out, RnB for when I'm running around, lo-fi for when
        I'm relaxing, I can tolerate Blue Grass but not so much Country. I enjoy video games such as Call of Duty, Fallout,
        The Elder Scrolls, etc. English is my primary language but I can read and write (and speak some) Russian. Head to my
        blog page for more info.</p>
